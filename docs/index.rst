Welcome to SFINCS's documentation!
======================================

'SFINCS' is the reduced-complexity model designed for super-fast modelling of compound flooding events in a dynamic way!

* For an introduction of the model see the journal publication: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2020.103796

* For a second application in tsunami modelling see the journal publication: https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse9050453

* More information regarding recent advancements with subgrid features can be seen in this online poster: https://agu2020fallmeeting-agu.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=9C-05-18-CF-F1-2B-17-F0-7A-21-93-E6-13-AE-F3-24

This online documentation describes the input files and parameters of the SFINCS model (Super-Fast INundation of CoastS).
The documentation is however still under construction, mail 'tim.leijnse@deltares.nl' for questions that are not answered yet by this documentation.
Also let us know when you are not yet a user of SFINCS, but are interested to get started!
The SFINCS executable is not yet shared open source, but will be in the future, and maybe in the meantime a collaboration is possible.
